title: Welcome to my notebook!

This is my (new) development notebook site.

## Why "Developmentia"?

Developmentia is the name of my site for now.  It came to me off the top of my
head as I was setting up the site and I needed to give it a title.  It's a
portmanteau of "development" and "dementia".  Is that a portmanteau?  I don't
know whether it follows strict portmanteau rules, but it feels like one to me.

I've been programming computers for many years.  I started learning when I was a
child, using my dad's Commodore VIC-20.  (I think I will probably write a post
about *_that_* at some time.)  After formal education about programming in
public school and college, combined with over three decades of professional
experience, I sometimes feel like I've forgotten some useful things and learning
new things sometimes takes a little longer than it used to.  Old dogs, new
tricks, etc. applies here.

Sometime along the way, programming morphed into "software development".  I
think that's a sign of maturity and increased complexity of what I'm
programming.  Forgetting things reminds me of loved ones I've seen suffer with
dementia.  Not that I think I'm getting it, too, but it's good to be aware of
it.  I'm not afraid of dementia, but I am cautious about it.

In light of that, this notebook has two goals:  To share what I've learned with
others and to be a reminder to myself of what I've learned and perhaps
forgotten.
